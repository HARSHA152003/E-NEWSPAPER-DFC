            <p>Former Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat silenced millions of her critics by defeating the world No. 1 and reigning Olympic champion Yui Susaki at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Vinesh also scripted history by becoming India's first woman wrestler to enter the finals of the Olympic Games. However, in a heartbreaking twist of tale, Vinesh was disqualified on the morning of her gold medal match for being 100 grams overweight. This not only put her out of the gold medal match, but also denied her the opportunity to win silver.Vinesh also filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), where she had requested to be awarded joint-silver in the Women's50kg event.

                However, earlier this week, her plea was dismissed by the CAS, while the details of their verdict is expected to come out later this month.
                
                In a now-deleted Facebook post, Woller Akos, Vinesh's coach at Paris Olympics, said he feared that the wrestler "might die" by the end of the five-and-a-half hours of intense weight-cut.</p>
